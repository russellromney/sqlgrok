# Contributing to sqlgrok

Thank you for your interest in contributing to sqlgrok! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sqlgrok.git
   cd sqlgrok
   ```

3. Create a branch for your changes:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature
   ```

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (edition 2024)
- Cargo (included with Rust)

## Building

```bash
cargo build
```

## Running Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

## Code Quality

Before submitting a pull request, ensure your code passes all checks:

```bash
cargo fmt        # Format code
cargo clippy     # Run linter
cargo test       # Run all tests
```

## Running Benchmarks

```bash
cargo bench
```

## Generating an SBOM

To generate a Software Bill of Materials in SPDX 2.3 JSON format:

```bash
cargo install cargo-sbom   # one-time setup
make sbom
```

The output is written to `target/sbom/sqlgrok.spdx.json`.

## Updating the Version

When releasing a new version, use the Makefile target to keep the version
consistent across `Cargo.toml` and all documentation:

```bash
make bump-version VERSION=1.0.0
```

This updates `Cargo.toml`, `README.md`, `docs/installation.md`, and regenerates
`Cargo.lock`. Always use a full semantic version (e.g. `1.0.0`).

## Project Structure

- `src/ast/` — AST node definitions
- `src/parser/` — SQL tokenizer and parser
- `src/generator/` — SQL code generation from AST
- `src/dialects/` — Dialect-specific parsing and generation rules
- `src/optimizer/` — Query optimization passes
- `src/tokens/` — Token definitions and tokenizer
- `src/errors/` — Error types
- `tests/` — Integration tests
- `benches/` — Benchmarks

## Conventions

- Use `thiserror` for error types
- Use `serde` for AST serialization
- Use `#[must_use]` on pure functions returning values
- Write unit tests alongside modules
- Follow [Rust API guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/)

## Submitting Changes

1. Commit your changes with a clear, descriptive commit message
2. Push your branch to your fork
3. Open a pull request against the `master` branch
4. Describe your changes and the problem they solve in the PR description

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue on GitHub with:

- A clear description of the problem or feature
- Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
- Expected vs actual behavior (for bugs)
- SQL examples if applicable
